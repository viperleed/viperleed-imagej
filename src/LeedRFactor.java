/** This class calculates of Pendry's R factor.
 *  It contains provisions to extend it to calculate a modified R factor,
 *  which must be also based on a Y function.
 *  Code for calculating the energy-dependent Y function is also provided.
 *  The derivatives are calculated in a very simple way, from the difference of
 *  the two values above and below the current point.
 *  Note that the viperleed.calc/TensErLEED R factor code calculates the derivatives
 *  with finite difference coefficients over 7 points (for interior points;
 *  fewer near the boundary). In case of large energy steps, this is more
 *  accurate than the simple difference done here.
