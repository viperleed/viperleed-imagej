/**
 *  This class analyzes a single spot with subpixel precision (aperture photometry).
 *  For background shapes CIRCLE and OVAL, the spot intensity is integrated over
 *  a circle and the background is a linear fit over an area around that circle.
 *  The outer border of the background area can be either a circle (with radius*sqrt2)
 *  or,  for OVAL, an ellipse with the same semiminor axis as the integration
 *  circle radius and the semimajor axis twice as large. The ellipse is oriented
 *  with the major axis perpendicular to the line between the spot and the screen
 *  center. For spots tangentially blurred due to poor azimuthal alignment (e.g.,
 *  thin films with imprefect azimuthal orientation), use shape=AZIMUTH_BLUR.
 *  Then the spot integration area is an ellipse with 2:1 ratio between major
 *  and minor axis, and the outer border of the background is the smallest circle
 *  encompassing the ellipse. In this cse, 'radius' is the semiminor axis of the
 *  integration ellipse.
 *  In all three cases, the area of the integration circle and the background area
 *  are equal. Since the noise is usually dominated by shot noise and the
 *  inhomogeneity of the grid, which both have a higher impact at higher intensities,
 *  the noise of the output (after background subtraction) will be dominated by
 *  the integration over the spot, not by the noise of the background.
 *  In the worst case, at very low spot intensities, the noise in the integration
 *  and background areas will be equal, thus the background noise increases the
 *  noise of the output by a factor of sqrt(2).
 *
 *  Output items:
 *  X - x coordinate of the center of the integration circle with subpixel resolution
 *  Y - y coordinate of the center of the integration circle with subpixel resolution
 *  INTEGRAL - integrated intensity of the spot, after background subtraction
 *  R_SIZE -  Assuming a 2D Gaussian, the sigma in radial direction with respect to
 *            the center given by x0, y0. This is based on the normalized central
 *            2nd moments.  For spots close to the center (within 'radius'), this rather gives
 *            the semiminor axis of the ellipse given by the normalized central 2nd moments.
 *            A correction is applied to account for small integration radii where sigma
 *            from 2nd moments is overestimated. The corrections assumes a circular Gaussian
 *            spot. (For AZIMUTH_BLUR, the correction is not very accurate and assumes
 *            an elliptical spot in tangetial direction, with an aspect ratio according
 *            to the integration ellipse).
 *  T_SIZE  - Assuming a 2D Gaussian, the sigma in tangential direction with respect to
 *            the center given by x0, y0. This is based on the normalized central
 *            2nd moments.  For spots close to the center (within 'radius'), , this rather gives
 *            the semimajor axis of the ellipse given by the normalized central 2nd moments.
 *            For AZIMUTH_BLUR, the value is scaled by the aspect ratio of the integration ellipse,
 *            so the ratio between the T_SIZE item and the spot radius can be interpreted
 *            as for circular spots.
 *            A correction is applied to account for small integration radii where sigma
 *            from 2nd moments is overestimated. The corrections assumes a circular Gaussian
 *            spot. (For AZIMUTH_BLUR, the correction is not very accurate and assumes
 *            an elliptical spot in tangetial direction, with an aspect ratio according
 *            to the integration ellipse).
 *  PSIGNIFICANCE - by which factor the spot is higher than the standard deviation of the background.
 *            The spot height is taken as the geometric mean of the peak height
 *            (assuming a 2D Gaussian as described above) and the average intensity
 *            in the integration circle.
 *            Values below NO_SIGNIFICANCE = 0.5 are set to 0 (these values are reserved for
 *            significance of positions inferred from neighboring spots).
 *            If the spot is not inside the mask, the value is NaN.
 *  BACKGR  - average background intensity
 *  BSIGMA  - standard deviation of background intensity

    /** Determines the exact position and analyzes a spot with a given starting position for the search.
     *  Before doing the measurement of the spot properties, tries to position the spot accurately.
     *  @param xs, ys The starting position for searching, in pixel coordinates. The spot must be nearby
     *    (within 'radius').
     *  @param x0, y0  The screen center, or for shape=AZIMUTH_BLUR, the position of the (0,0) spot.
     *  @param shape This determines the geometry of the integration and background area:
     *    The integration area is circle with the given radius, except for AZIMUTH_BLUR, where
     *    an ellipse with the major axis in tangetial direction [with respect to the (0,0) spot
     *    taken at the center] is used, The semiminor axis is 'radius' is used, and the length of
     *    the major axis is given by radius and azBlurRadians.
     *    For shapes CIRCLE and OVAL, the background region has twice the area of the integration region;
     *    the outer border of the background is circular for CIRCLE and elliptical for OVAL,
     *    with the long axis in tangential direction. With shape=AZIMUTH_BLUR, as long as the
     *    integration ellipse has an aspect ratio less than sqrt(2), the outer background border
     *    is a circle with r=sqrt(2)*radius (where radius is the semiminor axis of the integration ellipse).
     *    For more elongated integration ellipses, the background outline is an ellipse
     *    obtained by stretching the integration ellipse in radial direction [towards and away
     *    from the (0,0) spot] by a factor of sqrt 2.
     *  @param radius Radius of the integration area (semiminor axis for shape=AZIMUTH_BLUR).
     *    The radius also defines how far the refined position may deviate from the initial position.
     *  @param azBlurRadians For shape=AZIMUTH_BLUR, in the limit of large distances from the (0,0) spot,
     *    the semimajor axis of the integration ellipse over the distance from the (0,0) spot.
     *    this corresponds to the half-angle in radians under which the integration ellipse would be seen
     *    from the position of the (0,0) spots. For finite distances from the (0,0) spot, the
     *    semimajor axis smoothly changes from 'radius' when close to the (0,0) spot (i.e., we have
     *    an integration circle) to the distance from the (0,0) spot times azBlurRadians at very high
     *    distances.
     *  @param minSignificance Threshold for accepting a spot. The value is typically about 2;
     *    larger numbers lead to stronger background suppression
     *  @param image The input image.
     *  @param mask  Mask with values different from 0 defining the allowed area for measurements.
     *    Measurements are taken only if all pixels of the integration and background regions
     *    have mask pixel values > 0. Image and mask must have the same size.
     *  @param output An output array may be supplied to reduce unnecessary creation of objects;
     *    if it is null, a new array is created for the output.
     *  @return  The output array contains the values corresponding go X, Y, ... BSIGMA as explained
     *    in the description of the class (see above).
     *    If the position cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy, the X & Y output values
     *    are set to NaN and PSIGNIFICANCE in the output array is less than minSignificance.
     *    If the position is partly outside the valid area defined by the mask, all return values
     *    including the significance are NaN.
