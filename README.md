# viperleed-imagej

ViPErLEED-ImageJ is a collection of ImageJ plugins for spot tracking and intensity evaluation as well as selection and editing of I(V) curves created by the Spot Tracker. The output of the I(V) Curve Editor can be used as experimental data for the structure optimization.

Basic Instructions:
- Download ImageJ from
  https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html  or
  https://mirror.imagej.net/download.html

Open ImageJ, Help>Update ImageJ to the latest version (currently, 1.53i required).
If Help>Update ImageJ does not result in the correct version, take the ij.jar file from
  http://wsr.imagej.net/download/daily-build/
and place it in the ImageJ directory.

Place the plugin .jar file into ImageJ/plugins or an immediate subdirectory thereof and restart ImageJ.
The ViPErLEED plugins will appear in Plugins>ViPErLEED:
- Open Aida LEED video (opens .vid files of the legacy AIDA LEED data aquisition system)
- LEED Spot Tracker
- LEED I(V) Curve Editor

The Help texts of the Spot Tracker and I(V) Curve Editor will provide some basic explanations on these plugins.
